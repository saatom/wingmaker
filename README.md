# wingmaker
Octave script(s) for analyzing custom wing configurations and producing laser cutter files to produce relevant ribs and spars. Currently only supports source panel method CFD computations but will soon include vortex panel methods as well. Airfoil generation also currently limited to NACA 4 and 5 series airfoils with plans to include more in the future.
